<h2 align="left">What is it üîé</h2>

This repository refines the timestamps of openAI's Whisper model via forced aligment with phoneme-based ASR models (e.g. wav2vec2.0) 


**Whisper** is an ASR model [developed by OpenAI](https://github.com/openai/whisper), trained on a large dataset of diverse audio. Whilst it does produces highly accurate transcriptions, the corresponding timestamps are at the utterance-level, not per word, and can be inaccurate by several seconds.

**Phoneme-Based ASR** A suite of models finetuned to recognise the smallest unit of speech distinguishing one word from another, e.g. the element p in "tap". A popular example model is [wav2vec2.0](https://huggingface.co/facebook/wav2vec2-large-960h-lv60-self).

**Forced Alignment** refers to the process by which orthographic transcriptions are aligned to audio recordings to automatically generate phone level segmentation.

<h2 align="left">Setup ‚öôÔ∏è</h2>
Install this package using

`pip install git+https://github.com/m-bain/whisperx.git`

You may also need to install ffmpeg, rust etc. Follow openAI instructions here https://github.com/openai/whisper#setup.

<h2 align="left">Example</h2>

Run whisper on example segment (using default params)

`whisperx examples/sample01.wav --model medium.en --output examples/whisperx --align_model WAV2VEC2_ASR_LARGE_LV60K_960H --align_extend 2`

If the speech is non-english, select an alternative ASR phoneme model from this list https://pytorch.org/audio/stable/pipelines.html#id14



### Qualitative Results:

Using normal whisper out of the box, many transcriptions are out of sync:

Now, using *WhisperX* with forced alignment to wav2vec2.0:

(a) refining segment timestamps

(b) word-level timestamps

<h2 align="left">Limitations ‚ö†Ô∏è</h2>

- Currently only tested for ENGLISH language. Check 
- Whisper normalises spoken numbers e.g. "fifty seven" to arabic numerals "57". Need to perform this normalization after alignment, so the phonemes can be aligned. Currently just ignores numbers.
- Assumes the initial whisper timestamps are accurate to some degree (within margin of 2 seconds, adjust if needed -- bigger margins more prone to alignment errors)
- Hacked this up quite quickly, there might be some errors, please raise an issue if you encounter any.
